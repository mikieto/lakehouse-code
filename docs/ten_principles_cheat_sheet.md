# Ten Principles Cheat-Sheet

> *One page to recall every principle at a glance.*  

| # | Principle | One-liner (why it matters) | First hands-on chapter |
|---|-----------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | **Storage-centric** | Data gravity flips: compute now orbits storage. | Ch 1 |
| 2 | **Open Table Format** | ACID & schema-evolution without vendor lock-in. | Ch 5 |
| 3 | **Metadata-driven** | Declarative configs power self-documenting systems. | Ch 6 |
| 4 | **Everything-as-Code** | Infra / pipelines / policies all live in Git. | Ch 2 & 4 |
| 5 | **Shift-left CI/Ops** | Test & guard in PRs to avoid prod fire drills. | Ch 2 |
| 6 | **Loose Coupling & Event-driven** | Streams connect micro-domains without tight sync. | Ch 7 & 9 |
| 7 | **Observability & Lineage** | Trace every byte; measure SLOs continuously. | Ch 5 & 8 |
| 8 | **Security & Gov-by-Design** | Guard-rails baked into code, not afterthoughts. | Ch 4 & 6 |
| 9 | **Cost-aware FinOps** | Spend ≤ value; cost diff is code-reviewable. | Ch 3 & 10 |
| 10| **Serverless-first** | Auto-scale, pay-per-use, lower ops burden. | Ch 7 & 10 |
